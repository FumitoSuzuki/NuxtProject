            With SSR, also called "universal" or "isomorphic" mode, a Node.js server will be used to deliver HTML based on your Vue components to the client instead of the pure javascript.
            Using SSR will lead to a large SEO boost, better UX and more opportunities (compared to a traditional Vue SPA).
            Because implementing SSR on your own can be really tedious, Nuxt.js gives you full support out of the box and will take care of common pitfalls.`,

            Instead of switching to another framework and spending time to get used to it, why not kill two birds with one stone? (only proverbial üê¶üê¶)
            Nuxt.js supports generating a static website based on your Vue application.
            It is the "best of both worlds" as you don't need a server but still have SEO benefits because Nuxt will pre-render all pages and include the necessary HTML.
            Also, you can deploy the resulting page easily to Netlify or GitHub pages.`,

            Then the traditional SPA mode will likely be your choice.
            The outcome will be a typical Vue SPA as you know it but influenced by your Nuxt configuration and the framework itself.`,
